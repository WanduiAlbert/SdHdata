Data taken
-060216 (2nd day of data collection)
-Sample at ~-20 degrees
-1st set of measurements with new ramp rate
-Ramp rate = .1 As
-Lock-in acquisition rate = 4 Hz
-Time constant = 1 s (for all lock-ins)
-0 seconds of additional lock-in data (@ 4Hz - 0 data points) acquired before magnet began

Notes on data
-Phase kept changing over course of data collection
-current was approximately constant over the range of data collection
-Corrected the sampling rate issue, sampled at 4Hz for both lock-in and B
